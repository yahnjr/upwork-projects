They are an adventurous, go-getting, and passionate duo that will work with you every step of the way as partners to ensure that you accomplish your goals. They are both proud Colorado Natives, with family ties that date back to at least the late 1800s! After Lee graduated, he was commissioned as an officer from the prestigious United States Military Academy at West Point and went on to serve active duty for 5.5 years and another 4 in the Reserves. Lee has held multiple levels of responsibility from Platoon Leader, Company Executive Officer and most recently Company Commander of his Reserves Unit.\\n\\nKim and Lee were stationed in Hawaii, where their passion for Real Estate took hold. As a collective team they took the initiative to begin investing in real estate and managing their own rentals. Taking her passion for real estate to the next level, Kim jumped on board a top producing real estate team in Hawaii where she was able to build her career and later transferred back home to Colorado. As you can probably tell, these two are extremely proactive and diligent in everything they do.\\n\\nTrue adventure enthusiasts, Kim and Lee took advantage of their time in Hawaii. A few highlights from their time were skydiving, hiking to an active volcano, scuba diving with sharks and manta rays, witnessing one of the most rare surf competitions called the \"Eddie Aikau\", attending the Pro Bowl, and riding on Mules down the Northern cliffs of Molokai!\\n\\nKim and Lee utilize their competitive spirits on behalf of their clients – both buyers and sellers – to help them stand out among the others in this hot market. Whether writing strong offers with effective cover letters or preparing listings for maximum gain, they love to win. Kim is known for liking things clean and in order and she strives for the same in the way she runs her real estate business. Naturally personable, Lee is a problem solver and strong communicator. They bring this unique combination of skills to every transaction, achieving the best possible outcome.\\n\\nThey enjoy sharing their knowledge and expertise and educating others on the long term investment opportunities of real estate - whether its a place to call home today or a rental for passive income, there are many different ways real estate can be leveraged. They love that their job allows them to help others achieve the American Dream of home ownership and they especially believe that every Veteran deserves the opportunity to own a piece of land in the country they risk their lives to protect.\\n\\nWhen Kim and Lee aren’t working, they love to socialize and be outdoors. If they’re not by the water, you can catch them hiking, biking, and traveling. Kim enjoys running, and Lee is probably most competitive on the racquetball courts. They are also known to never turn down games with friends around the fire!\\n\\nKim and Lee’s words to live by: Service. Excellence.

A few highlights from their time were skydiving, hiking to an active volcano, scuba diving with sharks and manta rays, witnessing one of the most rare surf competitions called the \"Eddie Aikau\", attending the Pro Bowl, and riding on Mules down the Northern cliffs of Molokai!\\n\\nKim and Lee utilize their competitive spirits on behalf of their clients – both buyers and sellers – to help them stand out among the others in this hot market. Whether writing strong offers with effective cover letters or preparing listings for maximum gain, they love to win. Kim is known for liking things clean and in order and she strives for the same in the way she runs her real estate business. Naturally personable, Lee is a problem solver and strong communicator. They bring this unique combination of skills to every transaction, achieving the best possible outcome.\\n\\nThey enjoy sharing their knowledge and expertise and educating others on the long term investment opportunities of real estate - whether its a place to call home today or a rental for passive income, there are many different ways real estate can be leveraged. They love that their job allows them to help others achieve the American Dream of home ownership and they especially believe that every Veteran deserves the opportunity to own a piece of land in the country they risk their lives to protect.\\n\\nWhen Kim and Lee aren’t working, they love to socialize and be outdoors. If they’re not by the water, you can catch them hiking, biking, and traveling. Kim enjoys running, and Lee is probably most competitive on the racquetball courts. They are also known to never turn down games with friends around the fire!\\n\\nKim and Lee’s words to live by: Service. Excellence. Passion.","brokerage_logo":"https://mustwants-profile-pictures.s3.amazonaws.com/realtor/logo/LeeVanHorn_logo_1668383051026","location_type":"Point","location_coordinates_0_":-105.017522,"location_coordinates_1_":39.613808408163273,"mil_branch":null,"mil_other":null,"coverage_zipcodes_array":"['80125.0', '80015.0', '80123.0', '80122.0', '80017.0', '80214.0', '80419.0', '80601.0', '80453.0', '80022.0', '80293.0', '80026.0', '80231.0', '80033.0', '80221.0', '80241.0', '80130.0', '80112.0', '80224.0', '80211.0', '80514.0', '80128.0', '80019.0', '80457.0', '80210.0', '80107.0', '80516.0', '80116.0', '80024.0', '80234.0', '80290.0', '80232.0', '80204.0', '80260.0', '80220.0', '80027.0', '80236.0', '80294.0', '80233.0', '80113.0', '80011.0', '80045.0', '80230.0', '80010.0', '80207.0', '80219.0', '80212.0', '80202.0', '80127.0', '80030.0', '80229.0', '80249.0', '80031.0', '80504.0', '80109.0', '80121.0', '80454.0', '80104.0', '80124.0', '80237.0', '80235.0', '80227.0', '80004.0', '80020.0', '80134.0', '80016.0', '80126.0', '80228.0', '80238.0', '80640.0', '80602.0', '80520.0', '80111.0', '80246.0', '80216.0', '80131.0', '80110.0', '80005.0', '80021.0', '80465.0', '80239.0', '80264.0', '80247.0', '80222.0', '80205.0', '80215.0', '80002.0', '80003.0', '80023.0', '80530.0', '80138.0', '80120.0']"}},{"type":"Feature","id":41,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.524279999999976,36.95904900000005]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":41,"_id":"639a13a0f8620a0016d29f90","phone":"(757) 377-7282","profile_picture":"https://mustwants-profile-pictures.s3.amazonaws.com/realtor/profile/RobertRogers_profile_1671041808893.png","mls_names_0_":"Real Estate Information Network (REIN)","mls_names_1_":null,"mls_names_2_":null,"mls_names_3_":null,"mls_names_4_":null,"name":"Robert Rogers","brokerage":"Crescas Real Estate","__v":2,"bio":"Robert Rogers is a licensed real estate broker, and has been a proud REALTOR® since 2004.

That is what drew her to the industry thirteen years ago. As both a veteran and military spouse, she moved her family all over the country. Every move meant the daunting task of buying a new home and selling an old home while getting her family settled in a new community. But practice makes perfect. Her first-hand experience making sense of new markets, getting the best deals at the worst times, and transient home ownership made residential real estate and property management the perfect fit.\\n\\nAfter graduating from the United States Military Academy at West Point, she earned a commission in the US Army, where she served with distinction for six years. Her first assignment was Fort Bragg, NC, where she met her husband while jumping out of perfectly good airplanes. Her last assignment was Fort Belvoir, VA, where she had the distinct honor of serving Gold Star Families and military families with Wounded Warriors.\\n\\nAfter transitioning from the military, she earned her Master's in Corporate Communications to take her residential marketing skills to the next level. Her husband's final assignment was with USSOCOM on MacDill Airforce Base. They made some fantastic family memories and fell in love with Tampa. It was an easy choice to make Tampa their family's forever home after he retired from Active Duty.\\n\\nSunny's core belief is faithful service to family, friends, and community. She is active in her church and enjoys supporting and leading philanthropic events in the Tampa bay community. She enjoys an active membership in the Tampa Downtown Rotary Club, Board of Directors for West Point Society Florida, Board of Directors for 21&Change (Nonprofit serving special needs children), and Amazing Love Ministries (serving the homeless and less fortunate). She is the recipient of the 2019 Ambassador for Change Award presented by 21&Change.\\n\\nShe proudly serves as a real estate Broker in the Tampa Bay area to include St. Petersburg, Clearwater, and Sarasota, FL.

He served as a Surface Warfare Officer on the USS Monterey, at Special Boat Team 20, the Naval Postgraduate School, and at the NOSC in San Jose for reserve duty. He has completed wartime deployments and wartime training work ups. After leaving the Navy, he transitioned to selling real estate. \\n \\nHis first experience with the VA Home Loan came after his first brokerage told him these loans were not used in the bay area because the median home price was above the maximum loan limits for the area. Shortly thereafter, Joe sold his first home. A graduate of West Point purchased it for $1.3M, utilizing the VA Home Loan. He has since managed over $400M in transactions across the United States and Canada.\\n\u200B\\nDecades later, when Joe began touring homes for his own family, they noticed a pattern. Most of the seller’s agents they spoke with fell into two camps: they either were not familiar at all with the VA Home Loan’s slightly different process, or they were not willing to work with a family utilizing the VA Home Loan due to the myth of the loan’s longer closing period compared to others.\\n\u200B\\nWe eventually leveraged the VA Home Loan to purchase the home of our dreams. We know we can get your family the home of your dreams, because we’ve done it ourselves.\\n\u200B\\nNow, GI Joe Homes is dedicated to putting active duty military, veterans, and their families first.

This is why he takes the time to know every detail of a client's situation as he would his own, and uses his expertise to consider those specifics with the big picture of the real estate market. Balancing these factors ensures it is the clients' needs that are met, not his own or the industry at large.\\n\\nDiscipline and focus are also key tenets of Julius' work ethic. He takes time to know and communicate the ins and outs of a particular property and will provide straightforward answers to questions and concerns. He is keenly aware of the value of a clients' time and can be counted on 24/7 to help with small and large tasks, whether it's facilitating a negotiation or scheduling an appraisal during odd hours. Clients work with Julius directly--not an assistant--and he regularly consults a team of professionals as needed to solve the individual challenges of his clients.\\n\\nWest Point is known for the focus, team work, analytical skills, character and work ethic among its students, and Julius is a prime example of that.

After high school, I served in the United States Air Force for almost 22 years.  After moving my wife and 3 children around the world and back, to assignments in New Jersey, South Korea, Central and Southern California, Italy and Nevada, I decided to retire and hang up the uniform to be more present for my family.  I had become an expert at moving and finding places to live during the time I served and felt like this would be the perfect profession to transition into.  Uncle Sam moved us from San Diego, CA to Nellis AFB in 2013 and we have called Las Vegas (the 9th Island) home ever since.  In my free time, I love to travel and BBQ with friends and family.  I have been active with the Nellis AFB Asian Pacific American Association since 2014 to keep my family connected to our Hawaiian/Chamorro heritage.  I also love to volunteer at the USO's on both Nellis and Creech Air Force Bases and give back to our trooops, as often as I can.\\n\\nI learned many valuable lessons in the Military. I was able to complete my BS in Business Management, as well as a Human Resource Management degree, before completing my MBA.

I believe these skills and passion for helping others translate seamlessly to where I continue to serve, while helping others achieve the dream of home ownership.

My military background, coupled with my experience in financial counseling, auditing, and investment analysis brings a diverse skill set to the local real estate market.

Eager to make a difference, I became a behavior therapist, focusing on helping children with autism and related disorders.\\n\\nLife took another turn in 2018 when my husband's career in government contracting led us to Huntsville, Alabama. Embracing change, I continued my education journey, earning a Master of Science in Psychology in 2021. Determined to apply my skills in a new field, I swiftly obtained my Alabama real estate license.\\n\\nNow, as a real estate professional, I thrive on using my critical thinking skills and psychological insights to help others in this thriving market.
