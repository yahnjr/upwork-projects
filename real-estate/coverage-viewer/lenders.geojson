Growing up, my dad was a real estate agent who would take me on home tours and we would work on investment properties together – I was regularly sweeping floors and eventually helping with repairs. That knowledge and passion for real estate has stayed with me throughout the years. With a passion for helping clients find their dream homes and make strategic investments, I bring a wealth of experience and a personalized approach to every transaction. My experience includes working with first-time homebuyers, seasoned investors, and everyone in between. I have a proven track record of matching clients with properties that not only meet their needs but also align with their long-term financial aspirations. I believe that successful real estate transactions are built on trust, communication, and understanding. I take the time to listen to my clients, understand their unique needs, and tailor my approach accordingly. Whether you're a buyer or a seller, I'm here to guide you through the process, answer your questions, and alleviate any concerns you might have. Uniquely leveraged as a real estate agent and loan officer, I can provide insights that others cannot and better understand how one aspect of the process will affect another piece.
